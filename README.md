This repository collects related papers and corresponding codes on DP-based FL.

## Code
Tip: the code of this repository is my personal implementation, if there is an inaccurate place please contact me, welcome to discuss with each other. The FL code of this repository is based on this [repository](https://github.com/wenzhu23333/Federated-Learning) .I hope you like it and support it. Welcome to submit PR to improve the  repository.

Note that in order to ensure that each client is selected a fixed number of times (to compute privacy budget each time the client is selected), this code uses round-robin client selection, which means that each client is selected sequentially.

Important note: The number of FL local update rounds used in this code is all 1, please do not change, once the number of local iteration rounds is changed, the sensitivity in DP needs to be recalculated, the upper bound of sensitivity will be a large value, and the privacy budget consumed in each round will become a lot, so please use the parameter setting of Local epoch = 1.

### Parameter List

**Datasets**: MNIST, Cifar-10, FEMNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Shakespeare.

**Model**: CNN, MLP, LSTM for Shakespeare

**DP Mechanism**: Laplace, Gaussian(Simple Composition), Gaussian(*moments* accountant)

**DP Parameter**: $\epsilon$ and $\delta$

**DP Clip**: In DP-based FL, we usually clip the gradients in training and the clip is an important parameter to calculate the sensitivity.

### Example Results

```

#### Laplace

### No DP

```shell
python main.py --dataset mnist --model cnn --dp_mechanism no_dp
```
### Gaussian Mechanism

#### Simple Composition

Based on Simple Composition in DP. 

In other words, if a client's privacy budget is $\epsilon$ and the client is selected $T$ times, the client's budget for each noising is $\epsilon / T$.

```shell
python main.py --dataset mnist --model cnn --dp_mechanism Gaussian --dp_epsilon 10 --dp_delta 1e-5 --dp_clip 10
```

#### Moments Accountant

We use [Tensorflow Privacy](https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy) to calculate noise scale of the Moment Account(MA) for Gaussian Mechanism.

```shell
python main.py --dataset mnist --model cnn --dp_mechanism MA --dp_epsilon 10 --dp_delta 1e-5 --dp_clip 10 --dp_sample 0.01
```
See the paper for detailed mechanism.

### Laplace Mechanism

Based on Simple Composition in DP. 

```shell
python main.py --dataset mnist --model cnn --dp_mechanism Laplace --dp_epsilon 30 --dp_clip 50
```

## Remark

The new version uses [Opacus](https://opacus.ai/) for **Per Sample Gradient Clip**, which limits the norm of the gradient calculated by each sample.

This code sets the number of local training rounds to 1, and the batch size is the local data set size of the client. 
Since the training of the Opacus library will save the gradient of all samples, the gpu memory usage is very large during training.
This problem can be solved by specifying **--serial** and **--serial_bs** parameters. 

These two parameters will physically specify a virtual batch size, and the corresponding training time will be longer, but logically will not affect the training and the addition of DP noise. The main reason for this is to not violate the theory of DP noise addition.

The Dev branch is still being improved, and new DPFL algorithms including MA, F-DP, and Shuffle are implemented in it. Interested friends are welcome to give valuable advice!
